SystemVerilog code to generate the Fibonacci Series.
Fibonacci Series : The number at current position is equal to the sum of previous two numbers.
e.g. 0 	1 	1 	2 	3 	5 

The end the of the gereated pattern can be provided by setting tr.range. The default value of maxm = 5.

The simulation results are logged at the end of the program after simulating on Synopsys VCS.
